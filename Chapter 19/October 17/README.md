Attached are the Song and songs.txt files from Chapter 12 quiz.  Modify Song.java to implement the Comparable interface with Song in the angle brackets.  In compareTo method,

return 0 if both title and artist of the two Songs are equal.   If the titles are not equal, return -1 if this title String is less than the other title String and return 1 if this title is greater than the other title.  If the titles are equal, return -1 if the artist String is less than the other artist String and 1 if the artist String is greater than the other artist.

Create Song Driver and read the song information from the attached file into an array of Song.  Once the array is created from the text file, sort the array using BubbleSort.  You have been given an example of BubbleSort that sorts ints.  You must translate that to sort Song objects using compareTo
