Completion of this in-class will give provide you with a sorting method you can use in Homework 4.

1.	Choose a Sorting algorithm from the ones provided in Chapter 19 D2L - I suggest either InsertionSort.java or SelectionSort.java
1.	Convert the static method that performs the sort to be a generic method - current both only sort arrays of double - I want it to accept any object type that implements Comparable (see GenericBubbleSort.java)

Use the Chapter 19 slides on Generics to convert the methods to Generic and turn in the modified class file.   You can add a main that tests your sort algorithm with String or Song, but that is not required.  Turn in the new GenericInsertionSort.java or GenericSelectionSort.java to this assignment box.
