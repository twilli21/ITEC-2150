Attached is a class named StackOfIntegers.java.  It meets all coding standards.  

Write a Java class that reads in 10 integers (int) from the user.   Store the numbers read into an instance of the StackOfIntegers class.  DO NOT MODIFY StackOfIntegers.java.  Include it in your project and turn it in, but all your work should be in a new class with a main that you create.  This class stores int's in a stack.  A stack is a collection that stores items when you call the push(int value) method and retrieves them when you call the int pop() method.   The stack is a last in- last out way to store data.  It works similarly to a stack of items.  The last item you place on top of the stack (push) is the first one retrieved (pop).

Prompt for each number - do not simply say "Enter 10 integers"- I suggest a loop.

When all numbers have been "pushed" onto the StackOfIntegers.   Write another loop to "pop" them all out and print to user.  They should print in reverse order from how they were entered.
