Take your Homework 2 (Or the working solution provided in D2L) and convert the main() method to write the attributes of a completed Dragon, Unicorn and/or Human to a file instead of adding them to ArrayList (or do both).  The file should be readable by the program you wrote in the File Reading In-Class assignment.

Note:  This is an entirely separate program from the File Reading Assignment.
